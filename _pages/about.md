 Thanks for stopping by my website! My name is Andy Yang and I am (as of Spring 2020) a senior in Electrical Engineering. You can check out my [resume](/files/Resume v10.0.pdf) here, or look at my CV which has my complete list of projects and activities. Feel free to click around the site to see my project portfolio or read up on my blog to see what I am currently working on! 


About me
======
When interviewers ask me to give one word that describes me I usually go with tenacious. When working a particularly tough problem I tend to become obsessive over it. It is usually hard for me to let it go.  Therewithin also lies my weakness, I suppose, that when faced up against a wall, I tend to forget everything else around me (even if it means skipping a meal or two!). When in a rut, I turn to physical hobbies for relief. I am a big fan of tennis and rock climbing! Though I can not say I am excellent at either (yet). 


Academics
======
At UF I study electrical engineering, with my personal interests in power electronics. My interests here started pretty early when I built my own [electric bike](https://andyyangengineer.com/portfolio/EbikeProject/) my freshman year! 

I've been heavily involved with the university solar car design team [Solar Gators](https://www.ufsolargators.org/). I've worked in the group since my freshman year, making tons of friends along the way. My sophomore year I was the electrical lead, and helped redesign the system as well as integrate the electrical subsystem teams. As the electrical lead, I also took a role in meshing the electrical and mechanical systems.

Then during my Junior fall (Fall 2018) semester year I worked as the MPPT lead where I lead a team of sophomores and freshman in the task of designing a maximum power point tracker for harvesting energy from the solar arrays. My work was cut short by my internship at GE Appliances in the Spring of 2019, and by the end of my internship at Texas Instruments Summer 2019, I learned so many new design techniques for power supply design, I decided to scrap the project to start over. 

Now as part of the research lab with [PEEPRL](https://peeprlgator.github.io/Shuo.Wang/index.html) I am working on revamping the MPPT project as well as adding DPP ([differential power processing](http://www.ieee-ecce.org/2019/conference/tutorials-16/)) as a undergraduate applied research project under the guidance of IEEE fellow Dr. Shuo Wang. 

I also work as a teaching assistant for Power Electronics 1 and Junior Design. I TA'ed Power Electronics 1 Fall 2019 semester, and am currently (Spring 2020) TA'ing Junior Design.
