 Thanks for stopping by! My name is Andy Yang and I am (as of Spring 2020) a senior in Electrical Engineering. You can check out my [resume](/resume/) to see what I've been up to.


About me
======
When interviewers ask me to give one word that describes me I usually go with tenacious. When working a particularly tough problem I tend to become obsessive over it. When faced up against a wall, I tend to forget everything else around me (even if it means skipping a meal or two!). For stress relief I turn to physical hobbies: I am a big fan of tennis and rock climbing.


Academics and Engineering Interests
======
At UF I study electrical engineering, with my personal interests in power electronics. My interests here started pretty early when I built my own [electric bike](portfolio/EbikeProject/) my freshman year. I learned about managing battery packs by building a battery pack for the ebike from used laptop 18650 cells I got in bulk from ebay (don't worry I took precautions to maximize the pack capacity). 

My fascination with power electronics and my desire to make my career above power electronics was significantly influenced by my experience in [Solar Gators](https://www.ufsolargators.org/) the university solar car design team. I've worked in the group since my freshman year, making tons of friends along the way. My sophomore year I was the electrical lead, and helped redesign the system as well as ramp up new members. As the electrical lead, I also took on the role to facillitate teamwork and communication between electrical and mechanical systems. 

I've also helped teach Power Electronics 1 and Junior Design as an undergrad TA. I TA'ed Power Electronics 1 Lab (EEL 4242C) Fall 2019 semester and Junior Design / Design 1 (EEL 3923C) Spring 2020 semester.
