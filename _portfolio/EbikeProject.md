I started building the electric bike on a whim (and because I had [Red Envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) money left over from the holidays), I started by doing lots of research and reading about people's experience online. I decided to build an bike as opposed to a skateboard because I didn't know how to ride a skateboard (at that time).

As a freshman, I was only equipped with physics and electromagnetic knowledge from highschool physics, so I decided to not invest too much time designing the individual components in the system. I bought the BMS (Battery Management System), Motor Controller, and Battery Charger online. Also, I needed a normal bike to convert -- luckily the apartment complex I was living in at the time had an annual abandoned bike cleanout, and the maintenance man (who I spent the semester befriending) agreed to give me the least deterioted bicycle. 

The hard part was figuring out how to build the battery pack. Most people online used Li-poly predesigned packs for RC applications, but I figured that would be too boring. Since [Solar Gators](https://www.ufsolargators.org/) made their battery packs from individual 18650 cells, I decided I wanted to make mine the same way. 

The 18650 cells however were quite expensive. The [LG MJ1s](https://www.18650batterystore.com/product-p/lg-mj1-18650-batteries.htm) that the solar car team uses costs up to $5 a cell! The car uses something like 400 of these cells (20s20p). I read online that old laptop batteries used to use these same type of cells too, so I went on ebay to check for availability. Thankfully I was able to find a large stash of these cells!
